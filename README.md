# Subject

Generation of random numbers with a specified distribution.

# Description

Using generators (two generators of your choice) of uniformly distributed
pseudorandom numbers from [mod-1](https://github.com/qwordax/mod-1), create
generators of pseudorandom numbers with distribution laws 1â€“6 (two generators
per law).

Compare the obtained data from the two generators for each distribution law:

1. Output the theoretical and resulting mean and variance for samples
   $N = 10\ 000, 5\ 000\ 000, 10\ 000\ 000$.

2. Output the histogram for samples $N = 10\ 000, 5\ 000\ 000, 10\ 000\ 000$.

Select the best generator for distribution laws.
